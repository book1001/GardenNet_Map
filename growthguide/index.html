                        <h2>Introduction</h2><br><br>
  							<p>Like gardeners, we each cultivate our own territory. As we nurture our territory, we encounter various questions, from practical concerns—such as which designers and studios exist in the field we want to work in—to personal curiosities about what our peers are currently most interested in. It can be challenging for one person to find answers to all these questions alone. This zine encapsulates a collective guide, offering insights and connections to help us all grow and flourish in our creative journeys.</p>

                        <h2>What are some influences behind your graphic design work? </h2><br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’ve been listening to a lot of Lamp recently. I feel like their music helps me relax and move at a slower pace which I enjoy.</li><br>

                            <li>I love to listen to movie/TV/video game soundtracks in order to imagine visuals without any vocals and use those visuals as inspiration for my designs.</li><br>

                            <li>Museums! The best museums are MFABoston / the Palace Museum, China / Shanghai Museum, China / Louvre Museum / Doge's Palace / Museo Correr.</li><br>

                            <li>Vintage type, old books, and film posters are what most inspires me.</li><br>

                            <li>I incorporate a lot of irregular shapes/forms in the environment into my designs. Or the funky parts of Nature (weird patterns,& textures).</li><br>

                            <li>I love to follow illustrators on social medias and scroll through their works to get motivated into improving myself. Some of my favorites are Demizu Posuka, Yugo Limbo, and Scott Benson (all on twitter).</li><br>

                            <li>I love digital libraries: internet archive, people’s gd archive, typographic posters...</li><br>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>What are some of the best color palettes to use?</h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li>When creating color palettes, I like playful, high contrast combinations. I try to keep my color palettes for each project relatively simple, with only a few colors.</li><br>


                            <li>I love the color combination of pink, brown, and mint! I’ve never used this palette before, but I’ve always planned on using it in the future somehow.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>The best color palettes for me are less saturated colors. I also like to use only a couple of colors total and keep the design simple and clean.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I like fresh and natural color palettes. They will never cause nasty pages! (light colors)</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I like incorporating both warm and cool tones into one color palette, depending on the theme of the project.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I like to use bright colorful color palettes. When looking for what colors to use, I like to go looking for inspiration to see what colors fit with the topic and what colors can be a interesting combination that you might not immediately think of. </li><br>
                            
                            <li> There are so many good color palettes on Pinterest that I reference for inspiration. Mostly ones that are vibrant and are complimentary to each other since they can be very eye-catching. I also love Risograph colors. </li><br>

                        <h2>What’s the best and worst part about being a designer?</h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li class="best">You get to use a lot of creativity and can create a lot of different things.</li>
                            <li class="worst">It can be hard to know when something is finished since you can keep adding and changes things and making it better.</li><br>
                            
                            <li class="best">You get to be creative and utilize daily inspirations in your work.</li>
                            <li class="worst">Your creative freedom can be restricted or redirected with client work.</li><br>
                            
                            <li class="best">You get to be expressive and creative in your work.</li>
                            <li class="worst">Creative restrictions, especially when the people making restrictions are not designers/artists.</li><br>
                            
                            <li class="best">Being creative, being proud of your work.</li>
                            <li class="worst">Staring at a computer all day.</li><br>
                            
                            <li class="best">Talking to other designers about my work and learning about what others enjoy with design.</li>

                            <li class="best">There’s a lot you can do with design, so you’re never bored.</li>
                            <li class="worst">You’re usually designing FOR someone and might be limited in the design process. </li><br>

                        <h2>What would you like to pursue with your graphic design degree?  </h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li>I want to pursue packaging design. It allows me to combine creativity with functionality. Packaging is more than just a container—it's a way to communicate the essence of a product and tell its story through visuals and tactile experiences. I am especially drawn to creating sustainable packaging solutions that are eco-friendly and innovative.</li><br>


                            <li>I want to pursue art direction in advertising because it allows you to apply graphic design skills  into more functional projects.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I just want something with a consistent and reliable schedule. I want to design for some company or something similar in that realm. Anything but motion graphics.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I’d love to go into UX/UI work! I think creating apps and websites in this day and age can be very rewarding.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>Probably something more comic book/graphic novel related? I enjoy doing illustration work outside of graphic design and I think the skills I learn with this degree can help me in the field.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I’m thinking of going into medical illustration so I’m majoring in graphic design and minoring in biology. I think the overlap between these two subjects is really interesting and a pretty niche topic I’d be very interested in exploring more!</li><br>

                        <h2>What role does storytelling play in graphic design, and how does it affect audience engagement?</h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li>Storytelling can add onto the visual narrative and/or brand identity. it can help guide the user, making the user experience as seamless as possible.</li><br>


                            <li>It can help someone feel a certain things and think a certain way about what they’re looking at.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>Storytelling can add a deeper meaning to the piece.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>If a piece of graphic design can have the audience describe it’s beginning, middle, and end, then it’s already storytelling (use motion and change as much as possible).</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>It can give additional layers of meaning to the design, making it more impactful and emotionally engaging for the audience.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I think storytelling allows for viewers to gain interest and better understand concepts. Without a narrative, design can sometimes be difficult to relate to and comprehend, but guiding people with a story can be a powerful way to create responsiveness.</li><br>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Is there an overlap between functionality, aesthetics, and storytelling?</h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li>My process starts with my idea, and then I go based off the instructions given to me as well as the feedback. And I try to make the project happen in the most efficient way and I try very hard not to waste time if I don’t have to.</li><br>


                            <li>I think there is a big overlap between functionality and aesthetics because graphic design is used to convey any sort of message. It could be an emotion, an opinion, a fact, etc. You want the design to be aesthetically pleasing but also effective in what you want to convey.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I think visuals have the potential to be more impact-full than words, so graphic design can play a really big role in conveying important messages.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>This makes me think of how artwork (like paintings) can really talk to you and give you a message or tell a story just by being a picture and there has to be a way to translate that language into graphic design (or using the illustrations and adding graphic design on top of that)</li><br>

                        <ul><li>I would describe GD as the art of visual communication, though this definition is applicable to such a vast range of creative experiences, it is difficult to formulate a singular definition to be applied toward the art of design, and there is beauty in the different ways and unique approaches to understanding design.</li><br>


                            <li>I like to point to things like signs, posters, menus, etc. and tell my friends that graphic designers create them to help them understand what graphic design is.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I describe graphic design as the art of visual communication—it is about creating designs that can help convey messages, emotions, or ideas in a visually appealing and engaging way.</li><br>

                            <li>I take a break when I begin to feel frustrated or stuck. <br>
                            I try not to think about the project and come back a day or two later.</li><br>

                            <li>Start with something, but then take a break when it seems like you have a million ideas and just want to keep working. When you step back and go do something else, your brain will automatically start organizing your ideas and if you just wait like 25 minutes before starting, you’ll go into it with a much clearer head space. </li><br>

                            <li>Definitely when I start to become very displeased with my design and whatever I try to do, doesn't seem to fix it. Taking a step back and away from the design and looking at it the next day can give me a different perspective.</li><br>

                        <h2>Portfolio website or PDF portfolio? Both? What does your website look like? </h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li>Website is better, obviously both would be nice but if you have a website it’s a lot easier for people to access and find and you can have more interactive UI.</li><br>


                            <li>My website right now is mostly a white page that has a bunch of squares/rectangles. Each one is a project you can click on and look at and read info about. It’s similar to the way Instagram UI works on someone’s profile.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>With my portfolio website, try to emphasize quality over quantity. You may have made dozens of designs over your design career, but recruiters may only spend on average ~2 minutes looking at your website. Instead of using every piece, focus oon 3-4 projects you are really proud of and feature those in your portfolio. Make sure to detail the full process and documentation on these selected projects.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I’d go with portfolio website because I can include video and digital formats too.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>There’s pros and cons to each! A portfolio website can be easily accessible from anywhere and can be updated more easily. But it does require maintenance and you have to check it to make sure it runs smoothly. A PDF portfolio can make a great presentation for whenever you need to present to clients and can be viewed offline but it does limit the portfolio to only static images. So up to you in how you want to present your work!</li><br>

                        <ul><li>Search for areas of design that you are specifically interested in and apply there!</li><br>


                            <li>An advertising agency is a great place  for graphic designers because there are so many different jobs/positions that use graphic design, but are totally different. It could help you decide what you like and don’t like.</li><br>
                            
                            <li>For internship applications specifically, my strategy is having a clean website/resume with nice documentation, so I  don’t have a lot of experimental or creative aspects of my website. I’ve also trained myself to be able to quickly write a custom cover letter for every place I apply to.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I think US and Japan is fair game. There’s more design jobs, especially graphic design ones for some animation publications....(Never try China, really overflew of designers from every degrees).</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>To stand out, I develop a cohesive personal brand that reflects your unique style as a designer. From your portfolio website to social media presence, ensure consistency in how you present yourself and your work.</li><br>

                        <h2>How do you decide what fonts to use? What things do you look for in a font while starting a project?</h2><br><br>
                        <ul><li>Fonts are tricky! I have to try out several before settling on one. I try to match the energy of a project while keeping the font easily legible.</li><br>


                            <li>I try to look for versatility and character. Something I can use in several different ways that also has a distinct voice to it.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I like to line up a few different display typefaces that I think match the energy of my topic or project, then start narrowing it down and decide on the body type that blends well with the display.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I use the same display font over and over throughout my work unless something special fits better. Then I pair it with another font or two that relate to the topic thematically or fit the vibe of the design theme.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>I think about the tone or personality the design needs to convey. If the project is formal or professional, I might lean towards serif fonts. For modern or minimalist designs, fonts like Manrope or Poppins work better. I also consider whether the font family includes a variety of weights and styles (light, bold, italic) that allow for flexibility in the design. A versatile font family makes it easier to maintain consistency throughout the project.</li><br>

I create a mood board that captures the visual direction, focusing on colors, typography, and textures.

                        <ul><li>Either simplify your contents or come up with a general theme that makes them  cohesive. You can start by making an index!</li><br>


                            <li>To get out of artist block, I find it helpful to make something that’s not my usual style. It also helps to get back into creating with quick, low stakes exercises like collage and sketches.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>Planned out breaks/work sessions which can facilitate creative endurance.

                            <li>I think the best way of getting out of a creator block is stepping away from the work and taking time to do other things you like. Distract yourself from the work and then come back to it with a new perspective.</li><br>

                        <ul><li>I think it depends on the kind of project I do but if it’s for something cultural, I’d look into the significance of each color in the culture’s context. I think the meaning behind each color could also potentially give off different “vibes” and that also influences what kind of color palette I’d like to use.</li><br> 


                            <li>I think different cultures embrace different color palettes, so the colors you choose might affect the storytelling or message you are trying because it might suggest a specific culture.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>As a designer from a Chinese background, I often reference calligraphy or traditional style lettering in my typeface choice! You can check out Open Foundry and Linotype (if you don’t want to use an adobe font) for some bilingual typefaces.</li><br>
                            
                            
                            <li>Understanding cultural influences on color palettes and typefaces is really helpful and effective storytelling. I know in Mexican culture, vibrant colors like yellow, orange, and green are commonly used in festivals and celebrations, representing joy and community.</li><br>
